# Table-snippet
In this code snippet, we define a TableComponent that fetches data from a database or API endpoint using the useEffect hook. Inside the useEffect hook, you should replace '/api/data' with the appropriate API endpoint to fetch the data from your server. Once the data is fetched, it updates the data state using setData(data).

The table component then renders the data array using the map function to iterate over each item and generate table rows (<tr>) with corresponding columns (<td>) for each data field you want to display.

Make sure you adjust the table headers (<th>) and the mapping of data fields inside the table body (<td>) according to your actual data structure.

Remember to handle error scenarios, loading states, and any additional data manipulation or formatting as per your requirements.

Note: This code assumes you have set up a backend API that provides the required data from your database.
